    <p class="privacy__paragraph"><span class="privacy__title">PRIVACY POLICY</span>This Privacy Policy describes how FaceToon ("FaceToon", "We", "Us", or "Our") protects your privacy when you use FaceToon services ("Services") which includes the Web site (the "Site") and all FaceToon mobile phone applications ("Mobile").</p>
    <p class="privacy__paragraph">PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS DESCRIBED HEREIN AND ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH BELOW, YOU MAY NOT USE THE FaceToon SERVICES.</p>
    <p class="privacy__paragraph">This Privacy Policy applies to information (including personal information) collected during your use of FaceToon services. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, "personal information" means information that identifies you personally, either alone or in combination with other information available to us. Personal information does not include technical, device, or usage information that cannot be used to identify you personally, nor does it include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Services or about a group or category of Services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information have been removed. This Privacy Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate and non-personal information, and we may share such data about our users with third parties for various purposes.</p>
    <p class="privacy__paragraph"><span class="privacy__title">WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT</span>We respect the privacy of every individual who uses our Services. We collect certain personal information that you voluntarily provide to us. For example, we collect your name, email address, user name, social network information and other information you provide us when you register, set up an account, contact us by e-mail or use our services. We may also obtain information from other companies and combine that with information we collect on the Services; for example, when you link your account with Facebook, we might have access to your name and profile picture.</p>
    <p class="privacy__paragraph">When you visit the Site, we automatically collect some information. Such information includes the type of browser you use, your browser’s language, access time or the website from which you linked to us. We also collect information about your computer's operating system and information about your usage and activity on the Site. This information is only used to assist us in providing an effective service. We may, from time to time, supply the owners and operators of third party websites and mobile applications which have a link to our site or application with information about the number of users of our Site or Mobile. You cannot be identified from any of this information.</p>

    <p class="privacy__paragraph">We may also collect information about others if you use our Services to upload, share and/or distribute Content that contains information about them, including their name, image and online contact information.</p>
    <p class="privacy__paragraph"><span class="privacy__title">SERVICE DATA</span>To use our Services, you should provide a photo prior to the event of photo editing. Since the processing requires Internet connection and is performed on our servers the photos are sent there through the encrypted connection. We use Secure Socket Layer technology to protect the privacy and integrity of the transmission process.</p>
    <p class="privacy__paragraph">For non-registered users and users who don’t share their results within the Services, the original photos and results are automatically removed from our servers by two weeks after the last interaction. For registered users who share their results within the Services that provide special social network features, the shared content will be stored on the servers and shown within the Services unless a user either removes the images themselves or requests such a removal by contacting our support team.</p>
    <p class="privacy__paragraph">Whenever you choose an effect that involves face manipulations we use special face recognition technologies to:</p>
    <ul class="privacy__paragraph">
        <li>detect a face in a photo;</li>
        <li>find required facial key points (the set of points varies with the effect);</li>
        <li>and apply the effect to your photo.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="privacy__paragraph">The detected key points may be kept along with the photo on the servers of our providers for up to two weeks from the last interaction with the photo. The only purpose of this is to speed up any further processings of the same photos.</p>
    <p class="privacy__paragraph"><span class="privacy__title">COOKIES</span>We automatically collect certain information through the use of "cookies". Cookies are small data files that are stored on your hard drive by a Web site.
